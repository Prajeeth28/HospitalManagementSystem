# HospitalManagementSystem

This Hospital Management System is designed to streamline both admin and doctor site administration. The system allows administrators to create and manage admin accounts, including login authentication, password changes, and account updates. Admins can efficiently manage patient records, appointments, doctor profiles, department details, treatment information, and medicine inventories, with the ability to add, update, search, and delete data as needed.

On the doctor's side, the system enables doctors to create and manage their own accounts, log in using secure credentials, and modify their records. They can also adjust their availability for appointments and manage other relevant doctor-related information. The system is built to be user-friendly and highly flexible, ensuring ease of use for both administrators and doctors.
